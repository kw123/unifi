changes in V7.39.356@ 2021-04-02
==================  
1. removed old loggin method
2. added log statment for sitename pick in plugin config



changes in V7.39.356@ 2021-04-01
==================  
1. - added new schema for groups  
     There can be up to 8 groups of devices, the names of the groups can be set in config  
     Each groups counts the number of devices home (up) and away(down/expired)  
       They are shown as  variables  
         Unifi_count_groupname_Home  == number of device up  
         Unifi_count_groupname_Away  = number of devices not up  
         Unifi_count_groupname_lastChange  = datestamp of last count change  
     A device can be added/ removed in each devices edit or in menu/manage groups  
     The manage group option allows to add eg all wifi or lan devices to a group  
      and you can eg add/remove 10 individual devices on one screen faster than editing 10 devices  
     There is a a report on the groups, memebers etc in Print parameters  
   - several device model texts had typos  
   - various menu cosmetic  changes  


2. fixes  
   - block / unblock wifi devices had a cosmetic error message  
   - the site id name was always default, now can be set in config (not test)  
  




changes in V 7.38.356@ 2021-03-30
==================  
1. IMPORTTANT FIX 
   lastRead state was never updated 
   also new cameras were not added.
   the bug was added when I added the door bell
   dict["lastRing"]/1000 does not work if value is None  (not a doorbell camera)
   and the exception handling excluded anuything with "None" in its text (that the error condition when the plugin restarts)
   so the error message never showed

changes in V 7.38.355@ 2021-03-21
==================  
1. changed expect script for getting dicts from AP, switch UDMpro
   better timing, should result in much fewer restarts
   changed timing of listener starts, so taht hey do not run all at the same time
2. changed log level for listener restarts, now only every 3rd time level is warning 6th is error
   rest is  info / debug  in plugin.log file


changes in V 7.38.352@ 2021-03-15
==================  
1. fixed some exception handling errors
2. now handles overlapping events better eg
   doorbell has motion event and then a doorbell rung event before the motion event ends
   smart detected person or vehicle: it will cretae several events for teh same detection.
   they are shown in the variables
3. handling of orphan events in the plugin that do not create and end event. 
   those would keep the status at eg motion for ever or until when the next event occures 
4. added some more columns to the camera report


changes in V 7.38.350 @ 2021-03-14
==================  
1. smoothed some edges
2. added some more print camera columns
3. option to run event polling @ 0.5 secs


changes in V 7.38.349 @ 2021-03-13
==================  
1. added camera report menu item in Camera ....
2. fixed camId not found (in exception handling)
   fixed dev states not updated continuously

changes in V 7.38.348 @ 2021-03-13
==================  
1. added camera report menu item in Camera ....
2. fixed camId not found (in exception handling)


changes in V 7.38.347 @ 2021-03-12
==================  
1. smaller fixes for procted devices
   - handle expections
   - handle double devices  eg user has duplicated device, a devices was unmanaged and managed hence the cam-id changes, ..
   - and more exceptions like these 


2. now supports protect doorbell
   a door press is indicated as :
   eventType = "ring" instead of motion
   rest is the same eg status = "event", eb=vent start end and length are the same as for other events
   ==> as events can come in paralell there can be a motion event starts, the ring event starts and ends before the motion event ends 
       then the thumbnails will be updated in short sequence and the ring info will be overwritten
       so the eventType = "ring" will only be visible for a short period of time 

changes in V 7.38.346 @ 2021-03-11
==================  
1. added support for unifi protect cameras (this requires mac os 10.14 or higher)
   - get cameras from unifi systems and create indigo devices
   - the plugin will listen to events, create dev states for start time / end time/ time length of event 
     get thumbnails jpegs and or heatmap jpegs 
        enable / disable / configure thumbnails in camera device edit 
     events are also setting variables:
        Unifi_Camera_Event_Date  date string of last event; eg "2021-03-11 22:33:26"
        Unifi_Camera_with_Event  device name of camera of last event; eg "Camera_Reserve-UVC G3  Flex"
        Unifi_Camera_Event_pathtoThumbnail  path to last event thumbnail; eg "/Users/karlwachs/indigo/protect/Camera_Reserve-UVC G3  Flex_snapshot.jpeg"

   - get snap shots through menu or actions at any time, with selectable resolution
   - set parameters of cameras for IR-LED, status-LED, speaker, mic, motion trigger etc in menu and actions
   - added debug option for protect in config 
   - the dev/state "smartDetect" is blank or "vehicle" or "person" if the smart detect option is enabled to detect objects for events

 ==> to enable: set camera to protect in config (just above debug)
                and set repeat frequencies ...
     all camears connected / adopted by protect will be cretaed in the folder unifi_created.

==> how to use / setup:
    1. enable protect in config (bottom, above debug section)
       select "protect"
       set repeat query for device state checks and event tracking
       sel path for thumbnails
    2. Then trigger on any change camera xx dev/states["eventStart"] ==> new movement at camera xx
       or on variable Unifi_Camera_Event_Date 
       the path to the thumbnail is in dev/state "eventJpeg" and in variable "Unifi_Camera_Event_pathtoThumbnail" 
       eg: "/Users/youruserid/Camera_living window G3 Flex_snapshot.jpeg"
       the thumbnail are only availabe at the end of teh event (dev/states["eventEnd"] is changed to !=-1)
    3. Get snapshots at anytime: setup action with in unifi action "CAMERAS get Snapshot" then execute  at your pleasure
       or use menu/cameras/snaphot for testing or onetime pictures


2. added option to switch off queries to infi controller when you have osx13.x and lower and unifi controller v 6.x

changes in V 7.37.341 @ 2021-03-02
==================  
   
1. added option to ALSO use unifi controller db info for UP --> down
   enable in config for all/per-device/ non  unifi cleint devices
   if per-device: edit unifi client device in indigo and set to on/off
   it is doing an https get request to /stat/alluser and checks for last_seen
   if internal lastUp is expired it will check if last seen is later and will overwrite ie extending the expiration timer
2. fixed some spelling and removed options for read xx every yy secs, all set to 60 / 40 now fixed
3. made several options fixed = removed from config
4. tuned debug statements for dict/ message reads

7. manage debug logs in case of failure for ssh and http
8. added forced restart every xx hours for listener as option in  config / advanced
9. re-wrote queue management and threads to receive and consume messages. # of listener restarts is down significantly
   significant improvemnet of performance



changes in V 7.36.326 @ 2021-02-19

   if eg time is 12:07 it shows the bytes from time bin 12:00-12:05 

2. added some more reports for wan and wifi stats


changes in V 7.35.322 @ 2021-02-11
==================  
   
1. now all "post" function work for the new unifi op-sys.  ("get" worked fine)
   eg set AP-led on/off
   get wan / ap stats 
   etc



changes in V 7.34.322 @ 2021-02-07

changes in V 7.34.315 @ 2021-01-24
==================  
   
1. get site ID name dynamically from controller IF:   
   - not set
   or 
   - reset in config
    or

   this is mostly for installs that have 2+ sites and or have been upgraded from one device to the next 


changes in V 7.34.314 @ 2021-01-24
==================  
   
1. get site id name dynamically (in most cases:default)


changes in V 7.34.311 @ 2021-01-20
==================  
   
1. coded correctly the check for the port number 


changes in V 7.34.310 @ 2021-01-20
==================

2. added a retry to get the port Number of the controller


changes in V 7.34.308 @ 2021-01-20
==================  
   
1. added support for new unifi op system for controller os v 6.x ++
   eg UDMpro has unifi ops sys, but also genx cloud key can be upgraded to v 6.
   most reports work, but not stat reports (daily ,...)

2. will now autodetect the controller ports and login and api web pages, 
   no config setup required for:
   ie 8443/ 433;  /proxy/network/api/s/ vs /api/s; /api/auth/login vs /api/login


changes in V 7.33.308 @ 2021-01-05

changes in V 7.33.295 @ 2020-12-15
==================  
   
1. expect prompt string is now fully auto detect, uses 2 last character, most likely #_  (space)
     if the default does not work.
   Using the last 4 characters does not work as it likely contains the system version# and that might be differnt from AP to AP or switch to switch


changes in V 7.33.294 @ 2020-12-14
==================  
   
1. add a check, if prompt on unifi device does not work, 
   switch to the last 4 characters of promnpt when login in
   in most cases: "xx# " (and # needs to get a \) so "xx\# "


changes in V 7.33.293 @ 2020-12-13
==================  
   
1. fixed prompt on unifi wifi AP has changed.
   caused some expext connection to wifi AP to not recognize the line prompt:
   change was from BZ.v55.66.77 to BZ.55.66.77
   effectively not reading that AP info
 


changes in V 7.33.291 @ 2020-11-21
==================

==================  
   
1. added config optiuon to set folder name for unifi variables
   up to now: it used the folder where other variables where 
   now you need to set it in config.. default is UNIFI

 
changes in V 7.33.289 @ 2020-10-20

changes in V 7.33.284 @ 2020-09-12
==================  
  
1. fixed error isNew dow not exist -- only happened when UDM debug on


changes in V 7.33.283 @ 2020-08-14
==================  
  
1. added dev/states for gateway device:
      wan2        = up/downif2. wan port is active
      wan2Latency = same as  for wan
      wan2Upload  = same as  for wan
      wan2Gateways= same as  for wan
      wan2Nameservers= same as  for wan
      wan2PublicIP=  ip numebr of wan2 if wactive
      wanSetup =  "wan1 only" if normal single wan active
                  "failover"  if wan2 active and wan 1 down
                  "load balancing" if both wan1 and wa2 are active
                  "wan down"  if both wan connections are down
                  this is tested with std UniFi gateways, should also work for UDM-pro but not for UDM as it does not have a second wan port
     in case of failover the state values for publicIP nameservers and gateways  can be  set to == the wan2 value or not change
        if you would like to keep eg publicIP as your defined public ip number. if set to copy the wan2 values will be used to overwrite the wan xxx values.
 

changes in V 7.33.282 @ 2020-08-13
==================

changes in V 7.33.278 @ 2020-08-13
==================  
  
1. added dev/state wanSetup: "wan1 only"/"failover"/"wan down"/"load balancing"

changes in V 7.33.277 @ 2020-08-13
==================  
  
1. added dev/states for gateway device:
   wan2UpTime = xH yM zS
2. fixed some logic for fail over


changes in V 7.33.275 @ 2020-08-12
==================  
  
1. added dev/states for gateway device:
   wan2 (==up/down), MACwan2 = mac # of wan2
   use dev/states wan2 =="up" and wan=="down" to trigger wan failover
   use dev/states wan =="up"  and wan2=="down" to trigger wan failover end 
=== this currently only works for standard security gateway NOT for UDM/UDM-pro
    need "mca-dump" output from the UDM system when in normal state and when in failover



changes in V 7.32.275  @ 2020-07-25
==================  
  
1. went through all controller web api commands to set to proper GET PUT PUSH

3. added nClients as dev state for switches, == sum of clients connected exluding upstream
4. added check if gateway is connected to a port, (name nmust have gatew or udm in its string) Case does NOT matter 
   the it added "Gw" to the port_xx dev state
5. added client list for GHZ channel on AP. these are the hostnames given by the AP, not the indigo device names 
6. fixed LED .. commands, was switched to PUT, should be GET for regular gateways, not for UDM
7. added option to count clients on downlink ports and AP ports  in switch client totals  (nClients)

   reduce to lower value 


==================  

1. fixed: "key ipx not found in dict"

2. reworked logic for adopting automatically new UNIFI devices
   now will adopt / add an indigo device if
   a sw / ap / gw slot (in config) is "disabled and the ip number is NOT a valid one"
   it assumes that if there is a valid IP number and it is disabled it might be temporary setting by the user and will not change that
   when editing the IP number in config, you MUST edit the field then click on another text field. otherwise it will not save that field (thats from indigo)
     so when eg you edit the ip numebr and click on enable/disable, the ip textfield contents will not be saved.

changes in V 7.26.153  @ 2018-12-27
==================  

1. Getting (un)blocked info from controller immediately after plugin sets / unsets block status (required controller to be set to ON or ON reports
    Changed the timing interval for regular testing of (un)blocked to GT 60 sec. 
    As this now only applies to getting changes set directly on the web page of the controller.
    This check creates a big data data transfer (~60kBytes), hence doing it every 20 secs is not recommended, default is 3 minutes.

2. The received controller dicts ( dict-Controller_xxx for  xxx=device, users, ...) is written to the unifi directory next to the AP, switches, etc dict files.
    This is just FYI
