changes in V 7.27.169  @ 2019-02-09
==================  

1. will suppress certain states and variables from being logged in SQL logger. only works w indigo 7.4.1
   no change for lower  versions


changes in V 7.26.169  @ 2019-12-03
==================  

1. added option for gateway devices to select which MAC number to be used for reports
   gateways have several MAC numbers, and depending on version the query has to pick the proper MAC number for querries in the controller
   in device edit you can pick the mAC number (MAC or MAClan)



changes in V 7.26.168  @ 2019-06-26
==================  

1. the camera event logs from unifi have changed. Now handles also the new version


changes in V 7.26.167  @ 2019-05-18
==================  

1. added option to set read buffer for listeners.. for Mojave OSX 
   default is 32767, seems to be ok, just in case reading runs into error 22
   reduce to lower value 


==================  

1. fixed: "key ipx not found in dict"

2. reworked logic for adopting automatically new UNIFI devices
   now will adopt / add an indigo device if
   a sw / ap / gw slot (in config) is "disabled and the ip number is NOT a valid one"
   it assumes that if there is a valid IP number and it is disabled it might be temporary setting by the user and will not change that
   when editing the IP number in config, you MUST edit the field then click on another text field. otherwise it will not save that field (thats from indigo)
     so when eg you edit the ip numebr and click on enable/disable, the ip textfield contents will not be saved.  


changes in V 7.26.162  @ 2019-05-01

changes in V 7.26.153  @ 2018-12-27
==================  

1. Getting (un)blocked info from controller immediately after plugin sets / unsets block status (required controller to be set to ON or ON reports
	Changed the timing interval for regular testing of (un)blocked to GT 60 sec. 
	As this now only applies to getting changes set directly on the web page of the controller.
	This check creates a big data data transfer (~60kBytes), hence doing it every 20 secs is not recommended, default is 3 minutes.

2. The received controller dicts ( dict-Controller_xxx for  xxx=device, users, ...) is written to the unifi directory next to the AP, switches, etc dict files.
	This is just FYI


3. fixed : error=''dict' object is not callable' in print info
