2. reworked logic for adopting automatically new UNIFI devices
   now will adopt / add an indigo device if
   a sw / ap / gw slot (in config) is "disabled and the ip number is NOT a valid one"
   it assumes that if there is a valid IP number and it is disabled it might be temporary setting by the user and will not change that
   when editing the IP number in config, you MUST edit the field then click on another text field. otherwise it will not save that field (thats from indigo)
     so when eg you edit the ip numebr and click on enable/disable, the ip textfield contents will not be saved.

changes in V 7.26.153  @ 2018-12-27
==================  

1. Getting (un)blocked info from controller immediately after plugin sets / unsets block status (required controller to be set to ON or ON reports
	Changed the timing interval for regular testing of (un)blocked to GT 60 sec. 
	As this now only applies to getting changes set directly on the web page of the controller.
	This check creates a big data data transfer (~60kBytes), hence doing it every 20 secs is not recommended, default is 3 minutes.

2. The received controller dicts ( dict-Controller_xxx for  xxx=device, users, ...) is written to the unifi directory next to the AP, switches, etc dict files.
	This is just FYI
